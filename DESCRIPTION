Description: A collection of tools needed for conducting imprecise inferential framework is provided.   Poisson sampling model and zero-truncated Poisson sampling models are mainly studied as the part of larger project, Imprecise Probability Estimates for Generalized Linear Model.  Imprecise probability theory introduced by Peter Wally in 1991 is the basis of this inference.
